## Hotel check-in app concept built with JavaFX and MySQL

Problem: Tons of hotels/resorts tend to have a long check-in issue, a problem which is fostered by long line due to guest volume, insufficient staffing, and complex reservation issues.
Solution: Application online check-in

The idea is that the application would have shared access to the booking database, which it could verify login information from.

In the check-in form, the customer inputs his/her email, phone number, verifies the arrival date along with the room number and type, and is able to update services. Note that the customer can also update the room type, which will then be forwarded to front desk for approval.

## Admin Panel
The same application can be used by receptionists/front desk staff to review the check-ins made. By pressing Shift + A + L, the admin panel login prompt appears. Upon logging in, the receptionist can either accept or reject the check-in, and send an email with the respective instructions.
